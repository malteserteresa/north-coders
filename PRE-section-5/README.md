# Northcoders Precourse Section 5: Revision


Welcome to the final section of the Northcoders Precourse! Hopefully you've learned lots of new things over the last few weeks, got into the swing of using JavaScript to solve problems, and are excited about what's to come!

## Step 1: Revisit previous work

If there's anything you're not sure about from previous sections, now's the chance to go back and revisit it. Look again at any problems that you didn't completely finish in the final challenges, and push any changes you make up to your Github.

You should still be using the command line regularly - if you've abandoned it for 'easier' methods of navigating your file system, make sure you haven't forgotten all the commands as you'll use them extensively from day 1 of the Bootcamp.

## Step 2: Codewars

Don't forget that you still need to be aiming for at least 200 points on Codewars before the start of the course.

## Step 3: Functional Programming

If you're feeling confident with what you've done so far, how about adding a couple of new tools to your toolbelt? `map` and `filter` are methods available on all arrays (like `slice`, `pop` and `push`) and are extremely useful! 

Map allows us to transform elements in an array, and filter allows us to filter down an array based on elements we want to keep or reject.

Both of these things we can do perfectly well with for loops, but `map` and `filter` make it a lot easier, and arguably make our code easier to read.

Firstly, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=9a10b561-1e8b-405b-a677-73c215d264fb&feature=cards&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84&src_vid=Wl98eZpkp-c&v=BMUiFMZr7vk) on functional programming which explains how to use `filter` and how the same operation could be achieved with a normal for loop.

Then watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCqtb-Z5YGQ&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84&index=2) which demonstrates the use of the native map method, another classic example of functional programming.

We teach `map`, `filter` and other functional methods during the course so don't worry if you're not getting them just yet - you'll be able to complete the final challenge without them!


## FINAL CHALLENGES

### 1. Problems with map and filter

1. Fork the and clone this repository if you haven't already.
2. Like in sections 1, 2 and 4, `cd` into the finalChallenges directory and run the test suite to see what you need to do for each function in the `problems.js` file.
3. Work through each function in turn, running the test suite to see how you are doing. Some of the problems involve you applying transformations to an array, or filtering down an array - perfect use cases for you to practice `map` and `filter`. However, if you find it easier to work with for loops for now that's absolutely fine. A good idea for everyone could be to begin with solving the problems using loops and then refactor your code to use `map` or `filter` afterwards.
4. Remember to add and commit your work frequently.
5. When you are happy with your solutions, commit and push your work to your Github.
6. Once you've solved ALL of the problems and are happy with your solutions<a href='https://nc-precourse-review.herokuapp.com/complete?section=1' target='_blank'> request a review.</a>
