# Northcoders Precourse Section 2

Welcome to section 2 of the Northcoders Precourse!

In the last section you learned about git, the Version Control Software of preference among programmers, and started using Github. You also began to work on your problem solving skills by solving a number of Katas on Codewars.

This week we dive deeper into the JavaScript language and begin to work on some trickier problems.

But first...

## Step 1: Reading

Take a look at [Kyle Simpson's Up and Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going) book, which is a great intro to JavaScript and gives a thorough overview of the things you should understand at this point. Read the [Preface](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/preface.md), all of [Chapter 1](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md) and [Chapter 2](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch2.md) up until the section on 'Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)'.

You may also enjoy reading (or at least beginning!) Paul Ford's excellent article, [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)

It's a long read, but stick with it - it's probably one of the top articles of all time, on any subject. When Ford first published it in Bloomberg Businessweek, the magazine completely sold out and is almost impossible to get hold of in hardcopy now.


## Step 2: Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are common across all programming languages and allow you to match complex patterns in strings of characters. Have you ever wondered how forms know whether your email address is valid, or how the strength of your password gets rated? These are examples of common problems can be solved with regular expressions.

Work through [this tutorial](http://regexone.com/) to introduce the key components of Regular Expressions.

Finally, play around with writing your own regular expressions in [Regexr](http://regexr.com/). Some matches to try:

- A word with 8+ characters
- A word of 5 characters including at least 1 number at the end
- A sequence of words separated by underscores or hyphens
- A valid .com email address
- A valid .co.uk email address
- A valid mobile phone number beginning in 07
- A date in the format 11-01-2017 OR 11-02-17
- A hashtag or mention e.g. #mondaymotivation, @northcoders


## Step 3: Problem solving

Did we already mention that problem solving is an extrememly important skill for a programmer?

Please watch [these 5 videos by Michael Starbird](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEo7ej2RhHszJy_77UXC8GJpb8LtW-dJT). The first two in particular really chime with the Northcoders philosophy. Try to apply what you have learnt in these videos to the next coding problems you encounter.

If you haven't already done so, please work through some of the [Algorithm Challenges on FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-algorithm-challenges). All of the problems in this chapter are excellent practice - we recommend trying to solve 5 of them as a minimum.

## Step 4: Continue with Codewars

Remember to practise what you have been learning throughout the precourse by completing katas! Here are a few more katas to try. If you are getting through these quickly (i.e, under 20 minutes), try some level 6 katas.

[Powers of Two](http://www.codewars.com/kata/powers-of-2)

[Chinese Zodiac](http://www.codewars.com/kata/chinese-zodiac)

[Leet Speak](http://www.codewars.com/kata/toleetspeak)

[Product of largest pair](http://www.codewars.com/kata/product-of-largest-pair)

[Palindrome strings](http://www.codewars.com/kata/palindrome-strings)


## FINAL CHALLENGE

To complete section 2, you'll need to solve a few more problems and push your code to Github.

1. Fork, then clone, this repository if you haven't already.
2. `cd` into the PRE-section-2 directory and then into the finalChallenges directory.
3. Like last week, run `npm install` and then run the test suite (`npm test`) to see what you need to do for each function in the `src/problems.js` file.
4. Work through each function in turn, running the test suite to see how you are doing.
5. Remember to add and commit your work frequently.
6. When you are happy with your solutions, commit and push your work to your Github.
7. Once you've solved ALL of the problems and are happy with your solutions<a href='https://nc-precourse-review.herokuapp.com/complete?section=1' target='_blank'> request a review.</a>
