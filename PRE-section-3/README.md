# Northcoders Precourse Section 3 - HTML & CSS

Welcome to the third section of the Northcoders Precourse.

In this section you will be focussing on your HTML and CSS skills. If you have already worked with HTML and CSS you may not need to complete all the steps, but you still need to submit the final challenge.

Good luck!


## Step 1: Learn the basics of HTML and CSS

Please follow the [Codeacademy learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) and [Codecademy learn CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) courses on HTML and CSS. These units give a good overview of HTML and CSS, but if you want some extra practice or prefer the format of FreeCodeCamp, try the [FreeCodeCamp HTML/CSS material](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) out too.

One of the most important things to understand about HTML and CSS is the Box Model. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z0LjM4cM0o) explains it pretty well.

[LearnCSSLayout](http://learnlayout.com/toc.html) is also a brilliant guide on all aspects of using CSS to control layout. Combine it with playing around in [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) to practice what you've learnt so far in this section.

## Step 2: Get a reference resource

There are loads of great HTML and CSS resources online, but the sheer volume of elements, attributes and styles to learn means that it can take a while until it sinks in. To get you started, Here are a couple of reference guides and cheatsheets:

We like [this book](http://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf) which is well worth the investment in purchasing.

This freely available online book [How to code in HTML and CSS](http://howtocodeinhtml.com/) is also very good.

Some good HTML5 cheatsheets are available [here](https://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/)


## Step 3: Responsive Design

Nowadays most visits to websites are made on mobile and tablet devices. This means people are viewing sites on a range of different screen sizes, and we need to make sure our site looks attractive and provides a good user experience across all devices.

Responsive design is the process of designing and building our sites with this in mind. At a minimum, we'll want to consider using **relative units** when we specify sizes and positions with CSS. There is a short section on the [% unit](http://learnlayout.com/percent.html) on LearnLayout.

Read this article on [Relative Units](https://thecssworkshop.com/lessons/relative-units) and maybe try some out on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/).

Another thing we can do to make our site responsive is use Media Queries. Media Queries allow us to specify particular styling to be applied at specific ranges of screen sizes, giving us extra control over where we position things and how we size elements and typefaces on different sized devices. There is a short section on the [Media Queries]( http://learnlayout.com/media-queries.html) on LearnLayout.

Also read this [CSS Tricks Guide to Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/) and maybe try some out on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/).


## Step 3: Codewars!

Don't forget to keep working through [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/). By the end of this section, you should aim to have at least 120 points.

## FINAL CHALLENGE

For this section's final challenge, you need to demonstrate your HTML and CSS skills by building a visually attractive portfolio site. We have provided JPEGs for you as a guideline. We'd like you to follow the JPEGs as much as possible so that we can see your skills in translating a design into code, but feel free to change things like the colours, fonts, images and text to make it more personalised.

Your site should be **responsive** - i.e. it should look pleasant at different screen sizes. We have provided a mobile view but you should make sure that it looks good at all sizes down to mobile when you shrink your browser window. You might choose to do this using Relative Units or with Media Queries.

You should also show your ability to set up a project from scratch, linking the necessary CSS files and images.

Please note that your site does not have be be functional - i.e. the form does not need to submit. However, the links to external sites and other pages you've created should work. We suggest that the circular image is used as a link back to the Homepage.

You might find the following resource useful for sourcing technology icons: [devicon](http://konpa.github.io/devicon/)

And [fontawesome.io](http://fontawesome.io/) for including social media icons

#### Steps

1. Fork this and clone this repository if you haven't already. The JPEGs for the designs are included in the assets for this repository. Images you may want to use are included in finalChallenge/images
2. `cd` into the finalChallenge folder and set up your project as demonstrated in the tutorial video.
3. Build your site! Remember to make it responsive.

  We are looking for the following pages:

  - the Homepage
  - an About page
  - a Contact page

4. Remember to add and commit your changes frequently as you work.
5. When you are done, push your work to Github
6. Once you are happy with your website<a href='https://nc-precourse-review.herokuapp.com/complete?section=1' target='_blank'> request a review.</a>
