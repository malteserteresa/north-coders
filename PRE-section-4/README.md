# Northcoders Precourse Section 4

Welcome to section 4 of the Northcoders Precourse!

In the last section we learned about HTML and CSS and practiced setting up a static project from scratch. This time we're back to our core JavaScript skills, solving more problems.

We've gone a little easier on the reading to allow you plenty of time to complete the challenges.

## Back into the swing of problem solving

Remember to keep on working at [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/). Keep trying to solve problems just outside your comfort zone - it's the best way to improve.

## FINAL CHALLENGE

Once again, to complete this section you'll need to solve some challenges we've set you.

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine if you haven't already.
2. `cd` into the directory and then into the finalChallenges directory.
3. Like in sections 1 and 2, run `$ npm install` to install any dependencies and then run the test suite to see what you need to do for each function in the `src/problems.js` file.
4. Work through each function in `problems.js` in turn, running the test suite to see how you are doing.
5. Remember to add and commit your work frequently.
6. When you are happy with your solutions, commit and push your work to your Github.
7. Once you've solved ALL of the problems and are happy with your solutions<a href='https://nc-precourse-review.herokuapp.com/complete?section=1' target='_blank'> request a review.</a>
